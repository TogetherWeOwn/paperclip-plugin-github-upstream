# Changelog

## 0.1.0

- First release. ETag-conditional release scan (latest-release poll, one intake card per tag) and item scan (issue/PR/discussion tracking with deterministic wakes, label and description-header sync).
- Card mapping by `originId`, GitHub URL work product, and GitHub URL in the description, with `originKind`/`originId` backfill.
- Dry-run binary (`paperclip-github-upstream-dryrun`) that logs intended creates/wakes without making them.
